  abstract={Estimating risk of future impacts as driven by climate hazards, especially extremes, requires a robust characterization of these hazards' statistics. Earth System Models enable research on the earth's future climate under alternative plausible scenarios, but are extremely costly to run, providing only a limited number of scenarios/ensemble members. Earth System Model output emulators aim to supplement ESMs, allowing computationally efficient generation of new scenarios or realizations of internal variability, the latter being particularly important when studying extremes. In this paper we propose an approach to generating realistic time series of global daily precipitation fields requiring orders of magnitude less computation, using a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) as an emulator of an Earth System Model (ESM). Specifically, we present a GAN that emulates daily precipitation output from a fully coupled ESM, conditioned on monthly mean values. The GAN is trained to produce spatio-temporal samples: 28 days of precipitation in a 92 × 144 regular grid discretizing the globe. We evaluate the generator by comparing generated and real distributions of precipitation metrics including average precipitation, average fraction of dry days, average dry spell length, and average precipitation above the 90th percentile, finding that the generated samples closely match those of real data, even when conditioned on climate scenarios never seen during training.},

  abstract={Earth System Models (ESMs) are essential tools for understanding the impact of human actions on Earth’s climate. One key application of these models is studying extreme weather events, such as heat waves or dry spells, which have significant socioeconomic and environmental consequences. However, the computational de- mands of running a sufficient number of simulations to analyze the risks are often prohibitive. In this paper we demonstrate that diffusion models – a class of gen- erative deep learning models – can effectively emulate the spatio-temporal trends of ESMs under previously unseen climate scenarios, while only requiring a small fraction of the computational resources. We present a diffusion model that is con- ditioned on monthly averages of temperature or precipitation on a 96 × 96 global grid, and produces daily values that are both realistic and consistent with those av- erages. Our results show that the output from our diffusion model closely matches the spatio-temporal behavior of the ESM it emulates in terms of the frequency of phenomena such as heat waves, dry spells, or rainfall intensity.},

  abstract={Earth System Models (ESMs) are essential tools for understanding the interaction of the human and Earth systems. One key application of these models is studying extreme weather events, such as heat waves or high intensity precipitation events, which have significant socioeconomic consequences. However, the computational demands of running a sufficient number of simulations to robustly characterize expected changes in these hazards, and therefore provide a strong basis to analyze the ensuing risks, are often prohibitive. In this paper we demonstrate that diffusion models – a class of generative deep learning models – can effectively emulate the spatio-temporal trends of ESM daily output. Trained on a handful of runs, reflecting a wide range of radiative forcings, our DiffESM model takes monthly mean precipitation or temperature as input and is capable of producing daily values of temperature and precipitation that have statistical characteristics close to the ESM output. This approach requires only a small fraction of the computational resources that would be needed to run a large ensemble under any scenario of interest. We evaluate model behavior over a range of scenarios, time horizons and two ESMs, using a number of extreme metrics, including ones that have been long established in the climate modeling and analysis community. Our results show that the samples produced by DiffESM closely matches the spatio-temporal behavior of the ESM output it emulates in terms of the frequency and spatial characteristics of phenomena such as heat waves, dry spells, or rainfall intensity.},
