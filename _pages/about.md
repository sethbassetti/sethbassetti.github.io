Hi! I'm Seth Bassetti, a machine learning engineer and researcher from Cle Elum, WA. I have a passion for building machine learning models
and exploring how we can push the limits on artifical intelligence technologies! 🚀

I discovered computer science through pure chance while living a nomadic van life 🚐 in the southwestern US. On a semester off of my undergraduate,
I met someone on the road who introduced me to coding, which convinced me to continue my studies in a new field!

Since then, I have worked as a python developer in fintech, an educator and product manager with AI Camp, a
graduate researcher in computer vision at Western Washingon University! I recently began teaching at Utah State University to share my love of computer science with others!👨‍🏫 I continually find myself excited by new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what is possible with artifial intelligence.
