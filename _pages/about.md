Hi! I'm Seth Bassetti, a machine learning engineer and researcher from Cle Elum, WA. I have a passion for building machine learning models
and exploring how we can push the limits on artifical intelligence technologies! ðŸš€

I discovered computer science through pure chance while living a nomadic van life in the southwestern US. On a semester off of my undergraduate,
I met someone on the road who introduced me to coding, which convinced me to continue my studies in a new field!

Since then, I have worked as a python developer in fintech, an educator and product manager with AI Camp, a
graduate researcher in computer vision at Western Washingon University! I recently began teaching at Utah State University to share my love of computer science with others! I continually find myself excited by new technologies
and pushing the boundaries of what is possible with artifial intelligence.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
