Hi! I'm Seth Bassetti, a non-tenure track professor at Utah State University from Cle Elum, WA. I have a deep passion for computer science, education, and artifical intelligence.

I discovered computer science through pure chance while living a nomadic van life in the southwestern US. On a semester off of my undergraduate,
I met someone on the road who introduced me to coding, which convinced me to continue my studies in a new field!

Since then, I have worked as a python developer in fintech, an educator and product manager with AI Camp, a
graduate researcher in computer vision at Western Washingon University! I recently began teaching at Utah State University to share my love of computer science with others! I continually find myself excited by new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what is possible with artifial intelligence.
